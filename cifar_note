model 1: CNN 4 conv layer
    -   epoch: 23
    -   accuracy: 71.00%
    -   there is a sign of overfitting
    -> reduce number of layers and hidden units

model 2: CNN 3 conv layer
    -   epoch: 22
    -   accuracy: 74.61%
    -   still overfitting though we reduced number of hidden layers

model 2: regularized CNN 3 layer
    -   L2, weight decay = 0.001
    -   epoch: 100
    -   accuracy: 78.91%
